### Coding Challenge Guidelines

Given a JSON list of people and their dates of birth, write a function to list out the people whose birthday is today.

If a person was born on Feb 29th, then their birthday during a non-leap year should be considered to be Feb 28th. For simplicity, you can consider a leap year to be any year divisble by 4.

Input sample:

```JSON
[
	["Doe", "John", "1982/10/08"],
	["Wayne", "Bruce", "1965/01/30"],
	["Gaga", "Lady", "1986/03/28"],
	["Mark", "Curry", "1988/02/29"]
]
```
